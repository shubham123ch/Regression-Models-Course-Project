## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

data(mtcars)
#Exploratory analysis
#Results omited for not having enought space and not needed.
summary(mtcars)
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$vs <- factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars$carb <- factor(mtcars$carb)
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am,labels=c('Automatic','Manual'))

#Result shown in the Appendix
summary(mtcars)
#Regression model
full.model <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)
best.model <- step(full.model, direction = "backward")
#Result shown in the Appendix
#summary(best.model).
t.test(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)

boxplot(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars, col = "blue", ylab = "miles per gallon")

summary(mtcars)
#Regression model

summary(best.model)

boxplot(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars, col = "blue", ylab = "miles per gallon")
#plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10

par(mfrow=c(2, 2))
plot(best.model)
#plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11


```
